I'm so tired. It's 3 AM already and I'm sá»‰iting here with my laptop, staring my Facebook feed. I need to sleep, I need to sleep. I was supported to sleep very early tonight. 

Yesterday, I slept so late. I didn't have enough sleep this morning because I need to wake up early for work. My day was like sh*t. So I planed to sleep early today to avoid sleep deprivation.

Sadly, it's 3 AM again and I'm gonna have another sh*t day tomorrow?

No :(

What would you do when you feel tired? Will you choose to rest or you just try to continue to do things, anything, until you don't any other choice but have to rest?

I would choose to rest, but what actually happened is I continued to work.

Why would I keep doing thing unwisely? Why would I keep doing unproductive things? Why I'm regreting now?

This is just one example of how our action is controled by our true logic but by some other motive
