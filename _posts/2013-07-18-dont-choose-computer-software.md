title: If you want to be Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, don't choose computer or software

Bill Gates started a software company when no one else understand what is a software company.
Same as Steve Jobs, Apple I was the first computer for personal consumer.

It's more than 30 years already, computer and software changes the whole world. Nowadays, it's a crowded and established field and you probably won't get something big out of it. Go find something else. Especially if you are small startup!

Don't make me wrong. I won't say that if you want to be Thomas Edition, stay away of electricity. In fact, similar to electricity, computer becomes a means for us to reach higher achievements. I just want to emphasise 2 things:


  1. Computer and software are established spaces
  2. There always have more things beyond the horizontal. Go and find.
