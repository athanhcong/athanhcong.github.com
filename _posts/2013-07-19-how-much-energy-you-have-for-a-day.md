title: How much energy you have for a day
---
We all have 24 hours each day, but none of us have day similar to another.

We usually have different performance for each day. Some of us are doing great, some are always happy and lively, some feel tired and some lack of enthusiasm on anything.

  
It's also true even for 1 person, in different days we have different performance. I can be great and fight endlessly one day. Also I have dumb day, no energy to do anything, even don't want to eat, time fly so fast and yet we still want to find way to kill time.

  
So what happens with us on the dumb day?

  
I do believe that we have different level of energy for each day. How much energy we have for a day, will define how well we can handle life.

  
That energy level explains why there has days we even don't want to eat, can't make any work done.

  
The question is, how to make yourself full of energy everyday?
