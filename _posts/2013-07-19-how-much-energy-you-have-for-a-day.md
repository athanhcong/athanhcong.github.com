title: How much energy you have for a day
---
We all have 24 hours each day, but we don't have a day similar to another. Each of us has different performance for our day. Some of us are doing great, some are always lively, and some feel tired, others are  lack of enthusiasm on anything.

  
It's also true even for 1 person, in different days we have different performance. I can be great and fight endlessly one day. Also I feel totally dumb another day, no energy to do anything, even don't want to eat, time fly so fast and yet I still want to find way to kill more time.

  
So what happens with us on the dumb day?

  
I do believe that we have different level of energy for each day. How much energy we have for a day, will define how well we can handle life.

  
That energy level explains why there have days we even don't want to go out to eat, can't make any work done.

  
The question is, how to make ourself full of energy everyday? How to make ourself amazing everyday?
