title: Going from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur

---

This post just note about how I did my trip to Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia recently.

I choose to go by bus, so I booked the ticket online via www.busonlineticket.com. The ticket price is 30SGD. Not cheap. I know that If I go into Malaysia first, then take a domestic bus to KL, it should be cheaper. But I choose make it easy for a start.

There has 2 departure places, but I choose to go to CityPlaza, for easier to go by MRT. However after in bus, they still drive me to the other place. So, it seems better to come here.

First stop for visa check out of Singapore. When I fly into Singapore, there has a Embarkation White Card, which I fill in after visiting Singapore, I will go back to Ho Chi Minh City. I have a bit worry if anything's wrong if I'm not go back HCMC, but go to Malaysia. But everything seems to be very okay.

Second stop for migration into Malaysia. As Singapore, Malaysia also has a rule that you need to have a 2-round tickets for imigration. Just to prove that you will not stay here after visiting visa expired. I was worry about this too. I thought I need to buy ticket. But everything seems to be okay with only 1 way ticket.

Walk to my hostel Step Inn Guest House. I found it in Trip Advisor, it has cheap price for Dorm Room and very good review.

Unfortunately, the dorm room is out of rental, so I try the Single Room, which has double expense 35 RM. Not bad, a bit hot, there has a ceiling fan.
