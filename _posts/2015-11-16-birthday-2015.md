Yeah, today is not my birthday. It’s actually 4 months ago. 

I usually write something on my birthday, interestingly this year, I did not have chance to write, until now. 

Yes, the year is interesting. It turned out to have lots of love, lots of understanding. 
And now, I feel peaceful. 

I met a lot new people. Getting to learn about many new careers.

Backward to 2014, the year was not started nicely. 

My business was getting into stuck and I was into lots of difficulties. 

Direction? I have no idea what to do next. 

Belief in me? When you start something with a huge passion, with so much believes in it. You fill it with lots of extremely hard works. And then it turn out not going well… Where should you believe? Your gut feeling? Your vision?… Oh no... no. 

Finance? I funded for everything in my startup, all from my saving. OMG. Mom, troubles are "here and now"! 

And most important, I felt that I was not happy in life. 

_“Why?”_ - I asked myself. _“I’m trying so hard in life. Everytime. Every moment. Why? Why I’m not happy?"_

At the time, I was so frequently angry with girlfriend. I didn't like that, but it kept happening so many times. I didn't have a good connection with dad, with brother. I kept worry all the time about dad, living alone, in our far away hometown. And after all the years, I still kept feeling regret about my reponsibility in mom's passing away.  

I shut down things, many things, many connections. Slapping on the face and the pride, I try to close my startup as smoothly as I can. Stop almost connections with people around me.  

Learning from my startup, I know that every business starts with people. You need to understand people, your customers. For that happens, you first need to understand yourself. 

And for life, you have to be happy! 

I have to be happy! 

So, I pause things, and start a new quest, to understand myself. 

How to? I don’t really know. At the time, I was reading the book “Anger” by Thay Thich Nhat Hanh. A beautiful book. 

Where to go? I don’t know, I started to walk by myself and explore. 

_ _ 

Fast forward. 

It was a year with up and down. Lots of happy times and so much hard moments. 

Thanks the girl, who are always with me, share with me beautiful and difficult moments. When you have a deep connection with someone, it’s a gift of universe for you, to learn about your own self. 

I met Menis and start my journey into undertanding about unconcious. Learn to feel more, to express and to connect with my own self and people around me. This hugely opens my life. I’m unbelievably lucky. 
I spent lots of time, in the year, doing volunteering work with Essence. The Work of Love. 

I'm establishing more and more in Vipassana, the method was taught by Gautama, The Buddha. 
Knowing and practicing Vipassana is another unbelievable gift that I receive. The work is so effective. It’s so hard but I love it so much. I feel more and more peace and freedom with Vipassana. 

Lots of hard work. Lots of struggle. Crying time, down time. 

I keep trying. 

For peace and happiness. For love and connection. 

Seeing back the year, it looks like an operation into the mind, to face and to take out the things that burden me. To free me. 
The operation gives more pain to the wound, brings more struggle to life, but it must be done. 
If we face it, it will hurt, keep going and we all be healed once again. 

Bright days. Storm days. Everything will come and go. One truth I found, after all, life will keep getting better and better. 
The deepest moment of hurt is the moment we find the most valuable lesson. So, nothing visits our life without bringing us a gift. Everything comes to help us something. 

I love tree, it’s beautiful to see the green leaves singing in the wind. And the blue sky behind. Beautiful. Life is beautiful. And you are deserved to be happy. If it’s tough for you now, keep following your heart. Once day you will get the reward. 

My deeply appreciation to all the people who are with me, support me and raising me up in this journey. May peace and happiness be with all of us!
