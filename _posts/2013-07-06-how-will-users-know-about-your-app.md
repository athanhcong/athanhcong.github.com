title: How will users know about your app
---
The question struct me this morning, when I'm coding for a hackathon app. Our team are implementing on an idea for a new Chrome extension, then a girl stop by to chat and ask that question.

  
We did many planning discussion. We questioned what is the benefit of users after they use the app for a while? What is the utility aspect that make early adopter start to use the app? How do we integrate the app with current users' habit and avoid to educate a new habit? Eventually how to give incentives and make user engaged?

  
These are all very important question, but we haven't think about how users will find out our app? It's pure a marketing point of view. But it awakes me that I didn't have much consider about this before.

  
As I believe that marketing strategy should come from the product itself, so I think this is a basic question that we should put into product design discussion. Which means we should aim to build a product that can market itself.

  
Either in a viral way, words of mouth, social media or press or whatever..., this marketing strategy should be on easy day, don't try to build it first then go to sell later.

  
Sell first, sell early, sell often.
