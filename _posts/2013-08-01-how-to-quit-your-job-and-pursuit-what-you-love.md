title: How to quit your job and pursuit what you love?
---
It's not easy to walk your own path, so **don't quit!**  

But if you really want to start your thing, so bad, and don't know how to, here are my experience.

  
When I made my decision to quit, I'm still very scared. On one hand, I'm losing a good job, a good environment to learn and even the visa to stay in the country. On another hand, I'm facing problems: no secure finance, no teamwork, and above all I'm not really sure what to do next?

  
I just have a belief in myself and I have to do "something" before it is too late. 

  
So how?

  
It's great that I know about [30 Day Challenge][0] during that time. So I started for myself a 30 Day Challenge to Think On My Path. Everyday from that day, I wrote a note for myself about why I want to quit, what I want to do, ideas I want to execute, things I need to learn... whatever relates to my next step.

  
I wrote down notes whenever I had new cool ideas. Every night, I think about it. The road ahead gradually becomes clearer in my mind. Until, I have the confidence to let people know about my decision!

It's 6 months after I left my job, and I feel very happy with my decision.
