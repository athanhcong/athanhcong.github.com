title: Ask yourself who you want to be in next 5 years?
---
Today, I'm sitting down, breathing and asking myself this question. 

  
_What type of person I want to be in next 5 years? What type of work I want to do? _

_How will I wake up and spend my day, in the way that I feel the most satisfied?_

  
Imagine and see. 

  
I found that this kind of questions helps me sort my life. Pop out my priorities when I need to make choices and confused. Sometimes different options in life appear to be very similar, but in the long run, they are very different paths. Sometimes the same things we do today, can lead to very different outcome. You need to be very clear about what you want.

  
Above all, you can get some hints about what you should focus on, in order to maximise your ability.

Will the feeling of having a big company make me happy? Will I be super busy working on business stuff and managing? How about having lots of money and a luxury life? 

Won't. It's not those things that make me feel satisfied.

  
It's working with great people, inspire and get inspired. It's solving people' problems. It's helping others. It's making good impart on others lives. It's creating value.

If I won't do these things, I won't be happy. Whatever I plan to do, it should aim for this purpose.
