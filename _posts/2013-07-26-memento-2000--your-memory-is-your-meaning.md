title: Memento (2000) - Your memory is your meaning
---
Memento (2000) is a movie, it has this description in [IMDB][0]: "A man, suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife."

  
I really love the movie, not only how it is shot, but also the special message it carries:

  
**Our memory defines what we will do, what we want to be, and even what is the meaning of our life.**

  
Memory is so important, but we never know how important it is until we lose it.

If one day you wake up, suddenly not knowing where you are, having no idea what to do, walking around and don't know any body you meet Who are you? It's when you know you need your memory for your life.

  
_Movie lovers, if you haven't watch the movie, you should stop here, because I gonna to telling about it._

  
The guy in the movie can not remember whatever he did yesterday, the day before yesterday, one month ago and more... but still can remember everything happened more than one year ago.

How can anyone survives without meaning? No one can, this man can not either.

To survive, he makes his own meaning to survive. He creates a new memory system by notes and tattoos. He use whatever he can remember and create his new meaning of living. To revenge for his wife is the new reason why he wake up everyday. He tricks himself and never know about it.

**If you are completely forget your past, and define yourself with a new memory, you will become a different person.**  

  
This lesson is why I want to write about Memento. I don't have a condition of short-term memory loss, but when I'm travelling, I'm in a condition that make me constantly asking about my purpose of life. Why?

  
Moving into new place we are physically leaving our past: our familiar place, people, friends, daily habits. At the same time, we meet new people, making new friends, learn new things, forming new habits. The new world is exciting enough to capture all of our time. We are losing connection to the past and probably to the reason why we're travelling.

  
There have people who do traveling as a lifestyle, a life of moving. There have people who enjoy life by exploring new place, new people. There have people who travel to search for something, to find answer for a question. Whatever we want, travelling can change us a lot, it can transform our life.

  
It's not easy for me to start my travelling + working trip. I was so excited that I can do it. This is time for me to explore the world out there. I believe that there have something really great out there, something I never know before and travelling will teach me that.

  
Travelling does teach me a lot, but it also put me into a dangerous situation. Because I'm adding new memory every few weeks, I can unintentionally forget about my original purpose of my travelling trip. I may start a new lifestyle with different purpose of life without awareness of it. 

  
I want travelling make me a better person, not a changed person. I need to remind myself where I come from.

  
**Life is all about balance. Learn, change but don't get lost.**
